# As The Deer


## Verse 1
As the deer panteth for the water
So my soul longeth after Thee
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee


## Chorus
You alone are my strength my shield
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire
And I long to worship Thee


## Verse 2
You're my friend and You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other
So much more than anything


## Verse 3
I want You more than gold or silver
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joygiver
And the apple of my eye
