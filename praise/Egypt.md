# Egypt


## Verse 1
I won’t forget
The wonder of how You brought
Deliverance
The exodus of my heart


## Pre-Chorus
You found me
You freed me
Held back the waters for my release
Oh Yahweh


## Chorus
('Cause) You’re the God who fights for me
Lord of every victory
Hallelujah hallelujah
You have torn apart the sea
You have led me through the deep
Hallelujah hallelujah (oh) (whoa)


## Verse 2
A cloud by day
Is a sign that You are with me
The fire by night
Is the guiding light to my feet


## Bridge
'Cause You stepped into my Egypt
And You took me by the hand
And You marched me out in freedom
(Straight) Into the promised land
(And) Now I will not forget You God
I’ll sing of all You’ve done
Death is swallowed up forever
By the fury of Your love
