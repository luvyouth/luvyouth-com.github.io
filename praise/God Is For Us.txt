God Is For Us


Verse 1
We won't fear the battle
We won't fear the night
We will walk the Valley with You by our side
You will go before us
You will lead the way
We have found a refuge only You can save


Chorus
Sing with joy now our God is for us
The Father's love is a strong and mighty fortress
Raise your voice now no love is greater
Who can stand against us if our God is for us


Verse 2
Even when I stumble
Even when I fall
Even when I turn back still Your love is sure
You will not abandon
You will not forsake
You will cheer me onward with never ending grace


Bridge
Neither height nor depth can separate us
Hell and death will not defeat us
He who gave His Son to free us
Holds me in His love
