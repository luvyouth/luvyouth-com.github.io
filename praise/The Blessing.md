# The Blessing


## Verse 1
Let it be said of us
While we walked among the living
Let it be said of us
By the ones we leave behind
Let it be said of us
That we lived to be a blessing for life


## Verse 2
And let it be said of us
That we gave to reach the dying
Let it be said of us
By the fruit we leave behind
Let it be said of us
That our legacy is blessing for life


## Chorus
This day
You set life You set death right before us
This day
Ev'ry blessing and curse is a choice now
And we will choose to be a blessing for life


## Verse 3
Let it be said of us
That our hearts belonged to Jesus
Let it be said of us
That we spoke the words of life
Let it be said of us
That our heritage is blessing for life


Bridge
'Cause blessings and curses are choices
Will we build up tear down
The moment of truth is now


## Bridge
For Your kingdom for our children
For the sake of ev'ry nation
For Your kingdom for our children
For the sake of ev'ry nation
We will choose to be a blessing for life


## Ending
For life
Blessing for life
