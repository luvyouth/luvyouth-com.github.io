# No Longer Slaves


## Verse 1
You unravel me with a melody
You surround me with a song
Of deliverance from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone


## Chorus
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God
I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God


## Verse 2
From my Mother's womb
You have chosen me
Love has called my name
I've been born again into Your family
Your blood flows through my veins


## Bridge
You split the sea so I could walk right through it
My fears were drowned in perfect love
You rescued me so I could stand and sing
I am a child of God
