# Christ Is Enough


## Verse 1
Christ is my reward and all of my devotion
Now there's nothing in this world
That could ever satisfy
Through every trial my soul will sing
No turning back I've been set free


## Chorus
Christ is enough for me
Christ is enough for me
Everything I need is in You
Everything I need


## Verse 2
Christ my all in all the joy of my salvation
And this hope will never fail
Heaven is our home
Through every storm my soul will sing
Jesus is here to God be the glory


## Bridge
I have decided to follow Jesus
No turning back no turning back


## Bridge
The cross before me the world behind me
No turning back no turning back
